## new about
I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the University of Tübingen (MEG-Center) 
and a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow in the CherISH network.  

My research develops audio-tactile systems and training paradigms to improve 
spatial hearing in cochlear-implant users, combining EEG/MEG, multi-speaker 
arrays, and deep neural networks to design rehabilitation strategies for 
real-world listening.
